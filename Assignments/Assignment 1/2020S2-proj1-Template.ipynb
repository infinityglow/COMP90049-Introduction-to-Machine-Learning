You can combine both Gaussian and Categorical Naive Bayes (option 1) or just using Categorical Naive Bayes (option 2). Explain your decision. For Categorical Naive Bayes, you can choose either epsilon or Laplace smoothing for this calculation. Evaluate the classifier using accuracy and appropriate metric(s) on test data.
